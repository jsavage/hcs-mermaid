A lightweight HCS Parser and Visualizer implemented using Mermaid.js

Credits
This project was originally inspired by and draws upon great work by mstone in https://github.com/mstone/depict which is licensed under the MIT license as is this one.
This work was intended to re-implement the functionality but in a language I could better understand to facilitate enhancement.  
I originally explored the implementation in python and this work draws from that too.  See project text2hcs.
A later version will provide functionality to download the graphical output, to save and load the contents of the text input area and to save preferences.
